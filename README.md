# Roller Coaster Analysis

## Overview
This project conducts an analysis of a roller coaster dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartazansari/e-commerce-sales-dataset). It covers various aspects of data manipulation, cleaning, exploration, and visualization to derive insights about roller coasters.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about roller coasters, including their names, locations, manufacturers, opening dates, speeds, heights, types, and more.


## Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SartazAnsari/roller-coaster-analysis.git
   cd roller-coaster-analysis
   ```

2. ### Conda Setup
    1. Create a new Conda environment:
        ```
        conda create --name roller-coaster-analysis-env python=3.12
        ```
    2. Activate the environment:
        ```
        conda activate roller-coaster-analysis
        ```
    3. Install the required packages:
        ```
        conda install -c conda-forge ipykernel
        conda install -c conda-forge kaggle
        # if not installed
        conda install pandas matplotlib seaborn 
        ```
3. ### Python Setup (Alternative)
    1. If you prefer Pythonâ€™s built-in virtual environment
        ```
        python -m venv roller-coaster-analysis-env
        ```
    2. Activate the environment:
        * Windows:
            ```
            roller-coaster-analysis-env\Scripts\activate
            ```
        * Unix or MacOS:
            ```
            source roller-coaster-analysis-env/bin/activate

            ```
    3. Install the required packages:
        ```
        pip install ipykernel
        pip install kaggle
        pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
        ```

## Setting up the Kaggle API
1. Sign in to **Kaggle** and navigate to the **Account** tab of your user profile.
2. Scroll down to the **API** section and click on **Create New API Token**. 
3. This will download a file named ```kaggle.json``` containing your API credentials.
4. Place the ```kaggle.json``` file in the ```~/.kaggle/``` directory. If the directory does not exist, create it.
5. You're all set up! You can now use the Kaggle API to download datasets directly to your project.

## Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning:**
    * Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Explore various aspects of the roller coaster dataset:
        * Top years of coaster introduction.
        * Distribution of coaster speeds.
        * Fastest roller coasters.
        * Tallest roller coasters.
        * Types of materials used in  coasters.
        * Correlation between coaster attributes.
        * Average coast speed by location.
3. Data Visualization:
    * Visualize the findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative plots and charts.

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset is available in the project directory.
2. Import the necessary libraries and functions.
3. Run the provided Python script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
